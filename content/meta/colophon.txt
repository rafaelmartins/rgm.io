This page describes the website technical information, for those who are
curious about infrastructure details.


### Web hosting

This website currently runs on a dedicated server from
[Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/)
([EX42-NVMe](https://www.hetzner.com/dedicated-rootserver/ex42-nvme) from
Finland datacenter). I got it during the Finland datacenter opening sale.

The operating system is [Centos 7](https://www.centos.org/), and the services
are managed using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose]
(https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

This server runs all my websites and several personal productivity tools.


### Domain name

The `rgm.io` domain name was registered in 2013 via
[Gandi.net](https://www.gandi.net/en). It is composed by the initials of my
name and the [`.io`](https://www.nic.io/) TLD.

I decided to register this short domain name mostly to use its subdomains for my
project websites, to avoid registering a dedicated domain for each project.
Also, it was useful during the pre-[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/)
era, because I could buy a single wildcard SSL certificate for all websites.


### DNS

DNS for `rgm.io` is managed by [ClouDNS](https://www.cloudns.net/). I have been
using their services for several years, and their API makes it very easy to use
Let's Encript DNS-based validation.


### Source code hosting

The source code of this website is hosted by [GitHub](https://github.com/),
and is open source: [[https://github.com/rafaelmartins/rgm.io/]]


### Frontend technologies

The frontend is based on [Primer CSS](https://primer.style/css), the CSS design
system that powers [GitHub](https://github.com/).

A custom Primer CSS build is generated. It includes only the bundles
used by the website. It is built using [sassc](https://github.com/sass/sassc).
The SASS source files were extracted directly from upstream repository without
any changes, and are available in the
[`assets/primer/`](https://github.com/rafaelmartins/rgm.io/tree/master/assets/primer)
folder.

The website uses the [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org) script to highlight
code blocks. I downloaded a custom build from the official website, including only
the programming languages that I usually write code on. The style is `github`.
It also uses the [anchorjs](https://github.com/bryanbraun/anchorjs) script
to generate anchor links for the headers automatically, and a custom script to
resize embedded content automatically, according to the browser's viewport size.

The Javascript is unobtrusive, except for third party embedded content.
Navigating without using Javascript is suboptimal, but viable.

**Disclaimer:** I am **NOT** a frontend developer. :^)


### Backend technologies

This is a static website. The served files are generated by [blogc]
(https://blogc.rgm.io/) using a custom
[`Makefile`](https://github.com/rafaelmartins/rgm.io/blob/master/Makefile).
There's no magic here: the `Makefile` contains rules to build the HTML pages
and Atom feeds using `blogc`, rules to build the CSS stylesheets using `sassc`,
and rules to copy the static assets.

The web server is [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/).
